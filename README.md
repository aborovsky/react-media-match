__Mobile first__ react responsive framework made easy.

 - üêç mobile-first "gap-less", and (!)__bug-less__ approach.
   - In all the cases one rendering branch will be picked, and only one!
   - Never forget to render something, never render two branches simultaneously.
 - üíª SSR friendly. Customize the target rendering mode and `SSR` for any device.
 - üí° Provides Media Matchers to render Comonents and Media Pickers to pick a value depending on the current media.
 - üé£ Has hooks interface
 - üß† Good typing out of the box - written in TypeScript
 - üöÄ more performant than usual - there is only one top level query
 - üß® Controllable matchers

 ## Usage

 ```sh
 npm install react-media-match

 yarn add react-media-match
 ```

The core idea is to use object hashes to define how something should look like on all targets, protecting from wide bug variations and making everything more declarative.
```
<MediaMatcher
    mobile={"render for mobile"}
    // tablet={"tablet"} // mobile will be rendered for "skipped" tablet
    desktop={"render desktop"}
/>
```
### Concepts
Just:
1. Define once all your media queries (2-3-4 usual), and then use them _simultaneously_!
2. Define how application should look like on all resolutions.

Each Media Query is responsible only for a single "dimension" - width, height or orientation.
- If you have defined what Query should render on _mobile_, but not everything else - it will always use mobile.
- defined _mobile_ and _desktop_, but not _tablet_ or _laptop_? It will use "value to the left".

"Pick value to the left" is the core concept. It protects you from mistakes, and allows to skip intermediate resolutions, if they should inherit styles from "lesser" query.

- If you need to respond to screen size and orientation - create 2 separate matchers, and work with them - separately!
- If you need to respond to NOT screen or NOT media - just _provide_ values MediaMatcher should match against and that's done!

react-media-match was made with maintainability and mobile first approach in mind. It makes things simpler.

react-media-match provides two components and one function, and none of them awaits query as a prop,

```js
import { MediaMatcher, ProvideMediaMatchers } from "react-media-match";

<ProvideMediaMatchers> // this component will calculate all Media's and put data into the React Context
    <MediaMatcher
        mobile={"render for mobile"}
        // tablet={"tablet"} // mobile will be rendered for "skipped" tablet
        desktop={"render desktop"}
    />
    <MediaMatcher
        mobile={"render for mobile"}
        tablet={null} // nothing will be rendered for tablet, as long you clearly defined it
        desktop={"render desktop"}
    />
    
    // there are also range Components
    <Above mobile>will be rendered on tablet and desktop</Above>
    <Below desktop>will be rendered on mobile and tablet</Above>
    <Below including desktop>will be rendered on mobile, tablet and desktop</Above>

    <MediaMatches> // will provide matches information via render-props
        {matches => (
            <span> testing {
                // pick matching values
                pickMatch(matches, {
                    mobile: "mobile",
                    // tablet: "tablet", // the same rules are applied here
                    desktop: "desktop",
                })
            }</span>
        )}
    </MediaMatches>

    <MediaMatches> // will provide matches information via render-props
       {(_,pickMatch) => ( // you can get pickMatch from MediaMatches
           <span> testing {
               // pick matching values
               pickMatch({
                   mobile: "mobile",
                   // tablet: "tablet", // the same rules are applied here
                   desktop: "desktop",
               })
           }</span>
       )}
    </MediaMatches>
</ProvideMediaMatchers>
```
PS: Don‚Äôt forget to __wrap all this with ProvideMediaMatchers__ - without it MediaMatches will always picks the "last" branch.

## API

 react-media-match provides an API for "default" queries, and a factory method to create custom media queries.

 - `createMediaMatcher(breakPoints: { key: string })` - factory for a new API for provided breakpoints.
 The object with following keys will be returned:
   - pickMatch
   - useMedia
   - Matches
   - Matcher
   - Provider
   - Mock
   - SSR
   - Consumer

 There is also pre-exported API for default breakpoints - mobile, tablet, desktop

 - `pickMatch(mediaMatches, matchers)` - function, returns value from matchers matching `matchers`.
 
 - `useMatch(matchers)` - hook, returns value from matchers matching matches. This call is equal to `pickMatch` with autowired context.

 - `ProvideMediaMatchers` - component, calculates media queries and stores them in context.

 - `MediaMatches` - component, returns current matchers as a render prop

 - `MediaMatcher` - component, renders path for active match 
 
 - `Above` - component, renders children above specified point. Or including specified point if `including` prop is set. 
 
 - `Below` - component, renders children below specified point. Or including specified point if `including` prop is set.

 - `MediaServerRender` - component, helps render server-size
 
 - `MediaConsumer` - React Context Consumer

## Example
 - Define secondary Query for orientation
```js
import { createMediaMatcher } from "react-media-match";

 const Orientation = createMediaMatcher({
   portrait: "(orientation: portrait)",
   landscape: "(orientation: landscape)"
 });

 <Orientation.Match
   portrait="One"
   landscape="Second"
 />
```
 - Define query based on user settings
 ```js
 import { MediaMock, ProvideMediaMatchers } from "react-media-match";

 // override all data
 <ProvideMediaMatchers state={{mobile:true, tablet:false, desktop:false}}>
    ....
 </ProvideMediaMatchers>

 <MediaMock mobile>
     ....
 </MediaMock>

 <Orientation.Mock portrait>
     ....
 </Orientation.Mock>
 ```
 
### Usage with hooks
Keep in mind - only _value picker_ should be used as a hook, the _render selection_ should
be declarative and use `MediaMatcher`.
```js
const MyComponent = ({shortName, name}) => {
  const title = useMedia({
    mobile: shortName,
    tablet: name,
  });
  
  return <span>Hello {title}</span>
}
```
 
### Usage in life cycle events
> Requires React16.6+
```js
import {MediaConsumer, pickMatch} from 'react-media-match';
// use createMediaMatcher to create your own matches

class App extends React.Component {
  
  // provide Consumer as a contextType
  static contextType = MediaConsumer;
  
  componentDidMount() {
    // use `pickMatch` matching the consumer
    pickMatch(this.context, {
      mobile: 'a',
      tablet: 'b'
    })
  }
}
```

## Top level provider
If you want to react to a _media change_ you __have__ to wrap your application with `ProvideMediaMatchers`.
But if you don't - you might skip this moment.

### For example - media for "device pointer type"
Mobile phones(touch devices) don't have "hover" effects, while the onces with `mouse` - do support it.
More of it - this could not be changed in runtime - device type is constant.

This information might be quite important - for example you might control _autoFocus_, as long as 
_auto-focusing_ input on a _touch_ device would open a `virtual keyboard`(consuming 50% of the screen), which may be
not desired.

In this case you might omit `ProvideMediaMatchers` and use _default_ values, which would be computed on start time.  
```js
const HoverMedia = createMediaMatcher({
  touchDevice: "(hover: none)",
  mouseDevice: "(hover: hover)",
});

const MyComponent = () => {
  const autoFocus = HoverMedia.useMedia({
    touchDevice: false,
    mouseDevice: true,
  });
  
  return <input autoFocus={autoFocus}/>
}
```
 
## Server-Side Rendering

There is no way to support MediaQuery on the Server Side, so the only way to generate the expected result
is __to mock__ a predicted device.

We are providing a special component which will mock data only on server size,
and compare predicted media on componentMount on client size.

It also has a special prop `hydrated` which will lead to __forced react tree remount__
in case prediction was wrong, and rendered tree will not match hydrated one.
(use only in case of `ReactDOM.hydrated`)

```js
import { MediaMatcher, MediaServerRender } from "react-media-match";

<MediaServerRender predicted="desktop" hydrated>
    <MediaMatcher
        mobile={"render for mobile"}
        // tablet={"tablet"} // mobile will be rendered for "skipped" tablet
        desktop={"render desktop"}
    />
</MediaServerRender>
```
If prediction has failed - it will inform you, and might help to mitigate rendering issues.

#### How to predict a device type

You may use [ua-parser-js](https://github.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js), to detect device type, and pick desired screen resolution, or use [react-ugent](https://github.com/medipass/react-ugent) to make it a bit
more declarative. 

### Sandbox

# Testing and Mocking
Just provide `state` for ProvideMediaMatchers, and it will control all the nested matchers. Could be used to provide __not media-based__ rules.

 - `ProvideMediaMatchers` has a `state` parameter, and you might specify it override any information, and control all the nested matchers.
 - `MediaMock` will completely mock media settings.

 Both mocks are not working for `Inline` component.

 Testing and mocking are related to SSR rendering, and you may use MediaServerRender for tests and Mocks for SSR as well.
